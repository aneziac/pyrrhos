                Most monsters had already inhabited the material plane by the time Dwarves and Elves were created, however a few monsters were created or enhanced by the gods and demons. As a result, monsters that have the ability to think (i.e. Dragons, Aboleths, beholders) very, very rarely like or respect the gods and can become demons if left to their own devices for long enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, some monsters can have tenuous relationships of respect with the gods and remain simply as powerful entities throughout the world.

All that is known is that they have been constantly popping up in seemingly random places all throughout history.

Usually one of a kind beasts of great power, the kinds of monsters that folk tales are based on. I will be creating a variety of these so good luck, hehe.
