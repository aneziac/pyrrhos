                Demons are mostly evil beings of great power, not generally known to work together. Known to have enough power to the point where age does not affect them. They have power that ranges from barely killable by mortals to being able to rival the gods, and could technically “overthrow” the gods. Can be killed, but not forever. Demons are rare and usually plot their deeds in secret, with cultist-esc minions following them. Most are known to be okay with their positions as demons, very few have planned to overthrow the gods, and even less have actually attempted such. After being killed, they come back after a certain amount of time, and it seems that the weaker the demon, the faster they are revived.

                Common demon traits: Truesight, (depending on age) proficiency in more languages than normal, A kind of “barrier” that blocks them from holy and <a href="monsters.html#Celestials">celestial</a> powers (such as gods smiting them or appearing before them), vulnerability to radiant damage and resistance to necrotic.

                            Although his initial race isn’t definite, he has been theorized to originally be a <a href="races.html#Satyr">satyr</a>. Largely considered to be both the weakest and deadliest demon in history, he has died and come back several times throughout history, around once a generation, before being killed by a hero. He was previously a servant to another demon, faked loyalty in order to gain power before stabbing his master in the back. Has a very unique ability to shapeshift, although seems partial to a <a href="races.html#Satyr">satyr</a>-esque form when being “civil”. The lengths of time before they die again can vary, but there is always a hero to challenge them. Despite their status as being very weak, due to how often they revive, they have one of the highest kill counts of any of the demons. Additionally, not much is known about the heros who have managed to fell this demon. Currently Active, not many followers as he tends to murder them and prefers to remain mobile.

These two identical demons used to be a lone necromancer, however once he achieved demonhood he attempted to bypass the known “regenerative” state by cloning himself, resulting in what can be assumed as his soul either duplicating itself or splitting in half, creating two of the same demon, both hellbent on being the true “Animos” and looking for any way possible to put each other down for good.

He is mainly said to focus on maintaining his own wellbeing and fortune, and is one of the few demons to align himself in a more neutral position. After a lot of arguing and fighting Vito has managed to make a tenuous agreement with most of the world that he would provide the services of some of his servants through the use of Summon demon spells and magic contracts, in exchange for people leaving him alone. Additionally, he runs some other businesses both for people and demons, such as selling off his servants to other demons. He maintains a low profile and keeps his place of residence a secret for the most part, though he has recently been said to take up residence in <a href="geography.html#Orestes">Orestes</a>.
