	Tythalamos the Unsung: An <a href="races.html#Orc">Orcish</a> warlord who led his whole tribe into a massive battle over ownership of their ancestral land against a large number of soldiers. His entire tribe was wiped out in the battle but he himself killed every last enemy there. As he stood there alone on the blood soaked battlefield, the bodies of all his tribe members and enemies alike laying dead in the dirt, he shouted a battlecry so loud it could be heard miles away. Before he left the battlefield he took the helmet from the enemy commanders head and refashioned it to his liking before putting it on and never taking it off. It is said that his burning rage to avenge his tribe caused his axe to be engulfed in unquenchable flames.

	The <a href="politics.html#Calatios (Erebos)">Calatian</a> Royal Guard: Equally subject to envy and pity, there are 24 royal <a href="politics.html#Calatios (Erebos)">Calatian</a> guards that protect the sacred family. Their only purpose in life is to ensure that the empress and her relatives are never harmed; they don't care if they have to sacrifice <a href="politics.html#Calatios (Erebos)">Calatian</a> citizens, political representatives, or even themselves to protect the family. Each wields a royal spear, ceremonial shield, and a kukri to fight with, and the guards themselves are chosen through only the most arduous tests. Around their necks, they wear a rigid gold necklace adorned with the heads of lions to symbolise their ferocity and loyalty to the sacred family. On their right ring finger, they wear a diamond ring to symbolise their devotion to the safety of the empress.

	Some consider him a terrorist, others a myth. Regardless, as more and more disappear inside the Southern Woods of <a href="politics.html#Drusque (Erebos)">Drusque</a>, many of the country's citizens have begun to suspect that Themistokolis is more than just a wive's tale. He is depicted as a <a href="races.html#Satyr">Satyr</a> free of any inhibition, willing to indulge any depraved temptation inside his head. Said temptations revolve around decapitation, mutilation, and murder. According to the wive's tale from which Themistokolis sprang, he was a young and spry prince who partied every day and every night. This prince's parties were renowned throughout old <a href="politics.html#Drusque (Erebos)">Drusque</a>, and all of the country's affluent flocked to these events.
