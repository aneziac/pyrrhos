The Calatian Royal Guard: Equally subject to envy and pity, there are 24 royal Calatian guards that protect the sacred family. Their only purpose in life is to ensure that the empress and her relatives are never harmed; they don't care if they have to sacrifice Calatian citizens, political representatives, or even themselves to protect the family. Each wields a royal spear, ceremonial shield, and a kukri to fight with, and the guards themselves are chosen through only the most arduous tests. Around their necks, they wear a rigid gold necklace adorned with the heads of lions to symbolise their ferocity and loyalty to the sacred family. On their right ring finger, they wear a diamond ring to symbolise their devotion to the safety of the empress.
