Lucienos the Rebel; infamous throughout Kishori, Lucienos is hated by his fellow halflings, yet loved by the goblins they have enslaved. Once a merchant's son, Lucienos was banished to the fields as a slave after stealing from the local lord. Lucienos learned how to work the land, and befriended the goblins enslaved there. Soon, after bargaining with an unknown god in a vision, Lucienos gained magical powers. He razed the fields that he and his new goblinoid family were forced to work on, and killed his overseer. He led all the goblinoid slaves of his town into Northern Calatios. Afterwards, Lucienos began organizing the liberation of other goblins in Kishori, and led concentrated raids to free the slaves. Kishori has attempted to track him and the goblins down, but they have not been successful...
