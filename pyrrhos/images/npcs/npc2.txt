Tythalamos the Unsung: An Orcish warlord who led his whole tribe into a massive battle over ownership of their ancestral land against a large number of soldiers. His entire tribe was wiped out in the battle but he himself killed every last enemy there. As he stood there alone on the blood soaked battlefield, the bodies of all his tribe members and enemies alike laying dead in the dirt, he shouted a battlecry so loud it could be heard miles away. Before he left the battlefield he took the helmet from the enemy commanders head and refashioned it to his liking before putting it on and never taking it off. It is said that his burning rage to avenge his tribe caused his axe to be engulfed in unquenchable flames.
