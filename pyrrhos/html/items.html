You can use the attack action to fire the gun instead of making a melee or ranged weapon attack. If your class has the multiattack feature, you may instead replace any or all of the weapon attacks with gun attacks. The attacks have a range of 60 / 120 feet, deal 1d12 fire damage, and you use your dexterity modifier for the damage bonus. You must have firearm proficiency in order to add your proficiency to the attack roll.

Usually bottled in an extravagant crystal bottle with a ruby on the cork. The liquid itself is a brilliant red-orange color with a consistency similar to a strong wine. Upon drinking Ambrosia, you are bestowed with the effects of a <em><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:power-word-heal">Power Word Heal</a></em> spell. Additionally a creature which consumes Ambrosia will have missing or lost limbs restored as if affected by a <em><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:regeneration">Regeneration</a></em> spell. Ambrosia can be drunk thrice before the drink is all gone. Alternatively drinking the full bottle in one go will bestow a dead creature the effects of <em><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:true-resurrection">True Resurrection</a></em>.

                <em>Alter Gravity.</em> While wielding this sword, you can use a bonus action to increase its weight tenfold. While Alter Gravity is active, the sword deals an extra 1d8 slashing damage when it hits. If a creature with a strength score lower than 20 attempts to use this weapon’s ability, they have disadvantage on attack rolls due to its immense weight, and a creature with a strength score lower than 16 simply cannot wield the weapon at all. Additionally while the ability is active, the sword must be wielded with two hands. As an action, a creature attuned to the sword can reduce its weight back to 5 lbs.

Throughout history, the sword has been passed from person to person, each one being a person of legendary significance.

                <em>Conflicting Magic.</em> Attunement to both Venusdonoa and Evosferrum at the same time is not impossible, but causes a large amount of strain on the body. A creature attuned to both weapons must make a DC 23 constitution saving throw every hour that they remain attuned to them both or take 2d12 necrotic damage and have their maximum health reduced by the same amount as the damage taken, this damage cannot be reduced in any way. This hit point reduction can be restored to normal through the spell <em><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:greater-restoration">greater restoration</a></em>. A creature attuned to Venusdonoa can end their attunement to the weapon as an action.

                <em>Destroying the Sword.</em> In order to destroy Venusdonoa, a person must convince <a href="religion.html#Kor">Kor</a> himself to perform the deed. However, <a href="religion.html#Kor">Kor</a> may be reluctant to destroy such a creation and they may need to curry more favor with him in order to convince him. Alternatively, if Evosferrum is within 5 ft of Venusdonoa, the swords can be destroyed at the same time through the casting of a <em>wish</em> spell by a caster who can see them and is within 60 ft of the blades. When the blades are destroyed in this way, they explode in a blast of pure magical energy, all the magic in the two weapons fills a 30 foot radius centered on the blades. Every creature in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 + 100 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

                The specific origins of this sword are unknown. Although it is theorized to have been crafted by <a href="religion.html#Kor">Kor</a>, it is only a speculation.

Although at a glance the blade appears to be pure white, upon closer inspection its true beauty can be seen, the sword has almost every color imaginable barely visible upon the surface of its blade.

A couple titles the blade has been called in its history are The Blade of Vehemence and The Wedding Sword. The blade still remains in this cycle of circulation through these noble <a href="races.html#Dwarf">Dwarven</a> families.

                Evosferrum is a magic rapier that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When it scores a critical hit on an attack roll, the weapon does an additional 3d6 force damage. Once per turn when you miss an attack roll with Evosferrum, you can roll a d20. On a roll of 16 or higher, the attack hits. On a roll of 15 or lower the attack misses.

                <em>Spells.</em> While the sword is on your person, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: <em>counterspell (5th level version), tenser’s transformation, or antipathy/sympathy.</em> Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can’t cast that spell again from it until the next dusk.

                <em>Conflicting Magic.</em> Attunement to both Venusdonoa and Evosferrum at the same time is not impossible, but causes a large amount of strain on the body. A creature attuned to both weapons must make a DC 23 constitution saving throw every hour that they remain attuned to them both or take 2d12 necrotic damage and have their maximum health reduced by the same amount as the damage taken, this damage cannot be reduced in any way. This hit point reduction can be restored to normal through the spell <em><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:greater-restoration">greater restoration</a></em>. A creature attuned to Evosferrum can end their attunement to the weapon as an action.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Destroying the Sword.</em> In order to destroy Evosferrum, a person must convince <a href="religion.html#Kor">Kor</a> himself to perform the deed. However, <a href="religion.html#Kor">Kor</a> may be reluctant to destroy such a creation and they may need to curry more favor with him in order to convince him. Alternatively, if Evosferrum is within 5 ft of Venusdonoa, the swords can be destroyed at the same time through the casting of a <em>wish</em> spell by a caster who can see them and is within 60 ft of the blades. When the blades are destroyed in this way, they explode in a blast of pure magical energy, all the magic in the two weapons fills a 30 foot radius centered on the blades. Every creature in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 + 100 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

                The two blades consist of a longsword and a shortsword. Musashi’s Blades only function as a pair, and thus will not provide any benefit unless both blades are being dual wielded. For the purposes of dual wielding, the longsword has the light property. Attuning to the two weapons only takes one attunement slot. While attuned to Musashi’s Blades, your attacks become more powerful the more strikes you land. Whenever you land a strike with one of the blades, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls made using the swords. The damage bonus granted using this feature can stack, but you lose all of it when you miss an attack.

                This mirror has 4 charges. As a reaction to being hit by an attack you can see, you can expend a charge and attempt to mirror the attack towards the attacker. The attack must have an attack roll in order for you to mirror it. Make an Intelligence (arcana) check equal to 5 + the damage taken. On a success, you mirror the attack back towards the attacker with the same attack roll, as a spectral form of the same attack made against you appears in an attempt to hit the attacker. If this attack hits, it deals the same amount of damage that was dealt towards you. Additionally, if you succeed the check by 10 or more, you instead take no damage from the attack, though the damage of the mirrored attack remains as it would have been.

You can choose whether the bomb comes in the shape of a sphere or a cube, the cube is 10 inches on each side and the sphere has a 10 inch diameter. The bomb can then be thrown as an action to a location within 30 feet of you. A spherical bomb will roll an additional 10 feet before stopping on a flat surface, or will roll downhill if the surface it lands on is tilted. A cubular bomb will land at the point it is thrown and will not roll any further, however this does not mean it will stick to walls or any surface with a great vertical angle. As another action you can detonate the bomb, where it will then trigger an explosion with a 10 foot radius. Any creature in the area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The force of the blast will damage both creatures and objects, but will not light flammable objects on fire.

                <em>Magnesis.</em> The magnesis rune can be used to grab onto metallic objects using the magnetic energy that pours forth from the rune. As an action, you can cast the <em>telekinesis</em> spell targeting an object that is at least 70 percent metal. <em>Telekinesis</em> cast this way cannot be used to target a creature, but otherwise the spell functions as normal.

                <em>Stasis.</em> As an action, the stasis rune can be used to stop the flow of time for a creature or object that is large or smaller within 60 feet of you. However, stopped objects store kinetic energy and the stored energy will act upon the object when the flow of time resumes. A creature subjected to the effect must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn. An object subjected to the effect has it’s time frozen for 12 seconds (2 rounds), or until you dismiss the stasis as a bonus action. You can strike an object in stasis to build up kinetic energy on it before the stasis ends. The direction an object will be moved is determined by direction of the last strike made against it. The distance an object will be moved is determined by how much force the object is subjected to while in stasis and the weight of the object.

                <em>Cryonis.</em> As an action, you can use the cryonis rune to create a pillar of ice from a water surface of at least 5 feet wide. The pillar rises from the water with enough force to lift or move things, but not enough to cause damage. The created pillar has a square shaped base and is 5 feet wide and 7 feet tall and can be used as cover using the normal rules. The pillar has 25 hit points and as such can be destroyed through weapons and spells, once destroyed the pillar will shatter and the broken pieces will instantly melt back into water.

                While attuned to these glasses, you can read spells as easily as you can a book. As an action you can cast <em>detect magic</em> or <em><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:identify">identify</a></em> through the glasses<em>.</em> Alternatively, as a reaction to seeing somebody within 60 feet of you cast a spell, you can analyze the spell, telling you the name of the spell and what level it was cast at.

                A stone was discovered by an explorer trekking through a jungle and when she touched the stone it glowed red hot, burning her fingers. She wrapped it up with heat resistant materials and sold it to a blacksmith who crafted the strange stone into the head of a morningstar. While attuned to this weapon, you can speak the command word as a bonus action, causing the weapon to begin to heat up. On your next turn the weapon deals an extra 1d4 fire damage. On each of your following turns, the weapon continues to heat up dealing an additional d4 fire damage. This damage will stack, to a maximum of 4d4. Whenever you deal damage with the weapon you take half as much fire damage as you fire damage you deal.

                When you kill a creature with this sword they do not feel pain, but instead they are awash with a calm, understanding feeling. If you make an attack roll using the sword against a creature who is both unresisting and ready to face death by your blade, you can choose to automatically hit and end their life with one clean slice. Additionally you gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made using this weapon.

When you take the attack action with a melee weapon you may choose to make this attack at range by releasing a blast of magic from your weapon, you can use this effect on any or all attacks you make. The damage this attack deals is the normal damage of the weapon divided by two (adding all modifiers beforehand), the attack roll is the same as if you were to make a normal attack with the weapon. The range of the attack is 6 times the range of the melee weapon you make the attack with, i.e. the range of this attack with a longsword would be 30 ft, and the range of the attack using a halberd would be 60 ft.

                The Void Link is a heavy steel collar, which when clasped around the neck of a <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/monsters-by-type/humanoids">humanoid</a> will lock into place and not come off unless <em><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:remove-curse">remove curse</a></em> or <em><a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:greater-restoration">greater restoration</a></em> is cast on the bearer or the collar itself. One can only attune to the Void Link once they have a sufficient desire for more power. Once attuned to the Void Link, the collar’s lock strengthens and won’t come off unless the bearer wills it and nothing short of a <em>wish</em> spell or death will cause the collar to lose it’s lock and come off without it’s bearer’s permission. Whenever you take a short rest you regain twice as many hit points from any hit die you roll, and when you take a long rest you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your total character level. As a bonus action, you can enter a state of calm rage, as endless and deep as the sea, that lasts until you choose to end it as an action. While in this state, your Strength score is raised to 27 and your Dexterity score is raised to 25 but all attacks that hit you in this state are critical hits. Whenever you make death saving throws while attuned, you make them with disadvantage. However if you succeed on three death saving throws, instead of being stabilized, you instantly recover a number of hit points equal to twice your total character level. If you end up dying, you must roll a d100. On a roll of 51 or higher you suffer no adverse effects, on a roll of 50 or lower your soul is trapped inside of the collar and can only be freed with the casting of a <em>wish</em> spell or having an ally use their action while touching the collar to sacrifice their health and take 25 damage to their current and max hp in exchange.
