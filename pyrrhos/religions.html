<p><strong><u>Religions</u></strong></p>
<p>Since this world is partially inspired by Greece and how the gods of Greece interact with people, religion is very deeply rooted in the culture, and even people like clerics and Paladins would tend to pray to multiple gods for their different tasks. Additionally, rather than having “good” gods and “evil” gods, the gods have domains that tend towards a looser neutral interpretation.</p>
<p>Almost all people in Pyrrhos pray to the Gods even in everyday things, although most cultures will have one or two patron gods that the culture prizes above the rest.</p>
<p>While many of the different races are the product of Gods tampering with mortals, The gods do not have any technical “children” that they have birthed, although there are Gods who are in relationships with other Gods.</p>

<a name="Sorcerous houses"></a><p><strong>Sorcerous houses</strong></p>
<p>The magic-wielding Sorcerous Houses represent and honor their patron gods from the mortal realm much like other types of religious organizations. Independent of the laws and regulations of any country, the houses give the world of Pyrrhos many of its sorcerers, and a few select other magic users. These houses were founded independently throughout history, from a champion of its patron god, and today, the leadership of each of these houses is comprised entirely of the descendants of these founding champions. Additionally, despite being called “sorcerous houses”, the full organization isn’t strictly sorcerers, although the leadership always is. The functions of these houses vary from having many outposts throughout the lands to having a few where members come and go frequently on quests for their patron god.</p>
<p>House of Volkmer - Interacts with governments in attempts to ensure that countries have the betterment of their people in mind first. They do however respect the politics and ways of each country, and more focus on rooting out corruption and those who only seek power for their own benefit, as those are the most likely to go against true justice (justice in this circumstance is commitment to your own ideals and what you think is right when truly trying to better the lives of your people. Hypocrites are basically the bane of this house’s existence). Based in Tyrins, as well as being most of their respectable government.</p>
<p>House of Pyrin - Members take pride in learning to inspire those around them (bards) and to channel their strength for the betterment of themselves (barbarians and monks, maybe paladins). Additionally share a mindset of strength of willpower and ideals with the Minatour race, giving them a mutual respect and understanding. This house is based in</p>
<p>House of Kor - With leadership composed of educated <a href="races.html#Kobolds">Kobolds</a>, the House of Kor is the most recent Sorcerous house of the seven currently founded and is based in <a href="politics.html#Calatios (Erebos)">Calatios</a>.</p>
<p>House of Nevaeh - Interacts as an organization mainly just with the Galiman and the other houses, while members may be seen outside of the central location looking for lost relics and/or knowledge. Located in a city in <a href="politics.html#Galima (Erebos)">Galima</a> comprised entirely of schools and educational houses for non-members to learn</p>
<p>House of Adour - Isolated, doesn’t interact with many, except in the case of new beasts and such. Located in the Uninhabited forests of <a href="geography.html#Orestes">Orestes</a>.</p>
<p>House of Shaylare` - Interacts with Wizarding schools and actively seeks out forms of naturally occurring magic, such as stray sorcerers, and “touched” areas of land. Based in <a href="politics.html#Vasileios (Erebos)">Vasileios</a>, this house is led by <a href="races.html#Elves">elves</a> and tends to be quite selective in their membership.</p>
<p>House of Chyrillus - Is mostly isolated like the House of Adour, with agents going out to try and correct things considered “abnormalities” from nature(aka aberrations and unique monsters). This house is based somewhere in <a href="politics.html#Demetriades (Erebos)">Demetriades</a>, although it keeps itself on a low profile.</p>
