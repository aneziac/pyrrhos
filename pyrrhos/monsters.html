<p><strong>Monsters</strong></p>
<p>Most monsters had already inhabited the material plane by the time Dwarves and Elves were created, however a few monsters were created or enhanced by the gods and demons. As a result, monsters that have the ability to think (i.e. Dragons, Aboleths, beholders) very, very rarely like or respect the gods and can become demons if left to their own devices for long enough.</p>
<p>Alternatively, some monsters can have tenuous relationships of respect with the gods and remain simply as powerful entities throughout the world</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Fiends - disciples of demons who performed rituals to give them power, the power of the fiends depends on how many rituals their ‘master’ gave them, which usually depends on loyalty. (aka, the stronger the fiend, the more loyal to the cause of the demon)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Aberrations - Strange creatures with seemingly no origin. No one knows where they came from, and the ones intelligent enough to ask about them would… rather not talk about it. All that is known is that they have been constantly popping up in seemingly random places all throughout history.</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>Beasts -</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>Celestials -</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Monstrosities - Types of monsters that originate from before the Gods initial presence, with varying levels of intelligence, usually not to powerfull of monsters, there are many of each kind</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Plants - Plant monsters are semi-common plants that can pose any kind of direct or intentional danger towards a sentient species of Pyrrhos. These could have had human tampering, or be completely natural.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Fey - Those that originate from the feywild</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Undead - A soul that has managed to escape from the Spirit plane through one of the many holes out of the gaze of Nthanda. Some of these souls have come out themselves, some forced out (much to Nthanda’s shagrin). Some souls originated from the Spirit plane, and some are normal people who have been twisted into something less than. Before Nthanda’s ascension, there were many more undead crawling on the Material Plane, however the barrier between the two is weak, and holes are often made. A great number of undead in an area can sometimes symbolize an area where the barriers of the Spirit Plane have one such hole, but they rarely stay that way for long.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Constructs -</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Elementals - Beings born from the land of elementally touched areas, some are born stronger, and some are born with different moral persuasions. Many lack formal sentience and will as we know it, and those who are neutral can easily be persuaded to join the side of someone more powerful. There are four elder elementals in Pyrrhos, the oldest beings born from large elementally touched areas at their conception, one for each element. These beings have great knowledge, and great power, but are very careful who they give this knowledge to, and where they reside is often kept from public knowledge to the communities inside of the touched areas.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Unique Monsters - Powerful beings that are created from a variety of circumstances, some may be man-made creatures gone berzerk, or a nearly extinct race from a time before written history. Usually one of a kind beasts of great power, the kinds of monsters that folk tales are based on. I will be creating a variety of these so good luck, hehe. (note: demons are technically “unique monsters”)</p>
